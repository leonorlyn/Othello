1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
Yes, the computer player will choose the legal position which could flip most black tiles

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
In total, my computer player is smarter than me.
Although I could calculate total flips for every legal position too, but sometimes I will miss some postions or miss some directions when counting. 

3. How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
1) Scan the board to find all legal positions for computer
2) For each legal position, count the total number of black tiles it can flip (in eight directions)
3) Choose the legal position which has most tiles to flip

4. How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
Very often.
When we play the game, sometimes we simply choose the postion which can flip most white tiles on one direction, sometimes we could not recognize all possible flips

5. How would you improve it in the future?
Maybe try to let the computer to predict human player's move, and choose positions accordingly
